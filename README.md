# CS250SoftwareDevelopmentLifecycle

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the process of creating software from initial concept to final product. The course on the SDLC focused on the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the process, including the product owner, scrum master, developer, tester, and others. The course also covered both the waterfall and agile methodologies for software development, including their pros and cons, and how they can be applied to various types of projects.

By taking this course, I have had the opportunity to be exposed to the various stages of the SDLC and have gained a deeper understanding of the functions and goals of each role. I have also learned about the importance of collaboration and communication in software development, as well as the importance of regularly reviewing and iterating on the development process to ensure that the final product meets the needs of users. This knowledge and understanding will be valuable as I move forward in my career as a software developer, as it will also help me to better plan, execute, and manage software development projects, and ultimately deliver better products.


Question 1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program requires a user-centered approach to development. This means that you need to understand the needs, goals, and expectations of the users who will be interacting with the program. To achieve this, you can conduct user research, gather feedback from stakeholders, and engage in prototyping and testing to validate your assumptions. Creating "user stories" is a helpful tool in this process as it provides a clear and concise way to describe the features and functionality desired by the user in a way that is easy for the development team to understand.

Question 2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When approaching software development, it is important to have a well-defined process in place. This could include activities such as requirement gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment. Incorporating agile processes, such as Scrum or Kanban, can help ensure that the development work is delivered in a timely and efficient manner, while also allowing for flexibility and iteration based on changing user needs. Agile processes also encourage close collaboration between development teams and stakeholders, which can lead to better outcomes.

Question 3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development requires a number of skills and attributes. This includes effective communication, a positive attitude, the ability to work well with others, and a strong commitment to delivering high-quality work. It also means being open to feedback, being able to adapt to changing circumstances, and being willing to support your team members when needed. Additionally, it is important to continuously learn and stay up-to-date with industry best practices, as well as to be proactive in identifying and addressing any challenges that may arise during the development process.
